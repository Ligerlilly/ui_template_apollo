# Olio Skeleton

> React - Redux

Steps to get started: 
`npm install`

`npm run preflight` to make sure everything is running correctly

`npm run web` to start web server. Open http://localhost/3000 in a web browser.

# Olio Naming Conventions

> File name conventions

All file names will be snake cased, for example:

`my_page.html`
`blue_component.jsx`

> JSON conventions

We will use camel case keys and values, for example:

`
  {
	   "myKey": "myValue"
  }
`
